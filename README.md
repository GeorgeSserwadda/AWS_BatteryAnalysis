Battery Analysis and Issue Detection


Overview
This script performs battery analysis and issue detection for a set of stations, evaluating 
their performance based on various key metrics. The key performance indicators (KPIs) 
used for issue detection are:
1. Battery Performance Index (BPI)
2. Environment Effect on Battery (EEB)
These KPIs are calculated based on time-series data for the stations, and the analysis helps 
in identifying potential issues related to battery performance. The result of the analysis, 
including the detected issues, is saved in a CSV file for each station.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Battery Performance Index (BPI)
The Battery Performance Index (BPI) is a combined measure used to assess the overall 
performance of a station's battery. It is calculated by averaging five different metrics:
- Mode-Mean Difference (MMD): The absolute difference between the mode and the mean of 
the battery voltage measurements.
- Standard Deviation (SD): A measure of the variability of the battery voltage.
- Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD): The average absolute deviation of battery voltage from 
the mean.
- Coefficient of Variation (CV): The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
- Interquartile Range (IQR): The range between the 75th and 25th percentiles of the battery 
voltage distribution.
These five metrics provide a comprehensive view of the battery's performance. The BPI is 
calculated as follows:
BPI = (MMD + SD + MAD + CV + IQR) / 5
The higher the BPI, the more likely it is that there are performance issues with the station's 
battery.
Environment Effect on Battery (EEB)
The Environment Effect on Battery (EEB) measures how environmental factors (such as 
temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation) correlate with battery performance. It is 
calculated by taking the absolute values of correlations between battery voltage and 
environmental variables (temperature, solar radiation, logger temperature, precipitation, 
and lightning distance). The EEB is computed as the average of these absolute correlation 
values and is expressed as a percentage:
EEB = (sum of absolute correlation values) / (number of correlations) * 100
A higher EEB indicates a stronger environmental influence on battery performance, which 
could point to external factors impacting the battery's functionality.
Issue Detection
The Detected Issue is determined based on a combination of the BPI and EEB. The rules for 
issue detection are as follows:
High Battery Performance Index (BPI):
- If the BPI is greater than 10, the station is flagged for issues:
 - Power Issue: Detected if the EEB is less than 10%, indicating an internal battery issue. A 
site visit is recommended.
 - Old Batteries: Detected if the EEB is greater than or equal to 10%, indicating aging 
batteries that need replacement.
No BPI or EEB: Detected based on the mode of the battery voltage:
- No Issue: If the mode of the battery voltage is greater than 50, the battery is performing 
well.
- Hardware Issue: If the mode is less than or equal to 50, a hardware issue is likely, such as 
faulty components or the need for cleaning.
Moderate BPI (0 < BPI < 10):
- If the BPI is between 0 and 10, and the EEB is greater than 10%, the station is flagged with 
the issue 'Unstable Old Batteries'. This suggests the batteries may still work but need 
replacement soon.
No Detected Issue:
- If none of the above conditions apply, the Detected Issue is set to 'None'.
Script Usage
Input Parameters
Stations: A list of station identifiers to analyze (e.g., ['TA00001', 'TA00002', 'TA00003']).
Variables: The weather variables to include in the analysis (e.g., ['lb', 'te', 'lt', 'ra', 'pr', 'ld']).
Start Date: The start date of the analysis period (e.g., '2024-10-28').
End Date: The end date of the analysis period (e.g., '2024-11-12').
Output
The script generates the following outputs
1. Station Battery Summary: A CSV file containing the calculated metrics for each station, 
including the Battery Performance Index, Environment Effect on Battery, and Detected 
Issue.
2. Stations Without Data: A CSV file listing stations for which no valid data could be 
retrieved.
3. Timeseries Data: A CSV file for each station containing the raw timeseries data.
Running the Script
To run the script, ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., TAHMO, 
pandas, numpy). Then, execute the script in your Python environment.
Real-Time Issue Detection
For real-time issue detection, it is recommended to run the script over a period of 2 weeks, 
including the current date. This ensures timely detection of recent performance issues, 
allowing for prompt interventions.
Long-Term Network Audits
For general network audits, run the script for a minimum of 4 months to assess station 
performance over a more extended period. This allows for identifying trends and issues that 
may develop over time.
Summary
This script provides an automated method for detecting battery-related issues at remote 
stations based on performance metrics and environmental correlations. The Battery 
Performance Index (BPI) and Environment Effect on Battery (EEB) are the two key metrics 
used for issue detection. By analyzing these indicators, the script identifies issues like 
power faults, old batteries, and hardware problems, helping to ensure optimal station 
performance.
For ongoing monitoring and effective issue detection, run the script periodically for both 
short-term real-time assessments and long-term audits of station performance.

Battery Analysis and Issue Detection Process

Data Collection

Collect measurements for each station.
Data range: Use the last two weeks for real-time detection; at least four months for a network audit.
Data Processing

Clean data by removing rows with missing values in key columns (lb and te).
Calculate required statistics if valid data exists.
KPI Calculation

Battery Performance Index (BPI): Average of mmd, std, mad, cv, and iqr.
BPI > 10 indicates potential issues.

Environment Effect on Battery (EEB): Average of absolute values of correlations (lb vs. environmental variables).
EEB < 10% suggests low environmental impact.
Issue Detection Logic

If BPI > 10 and EEB < 10%: Marked as "Power Issue (Site Visit Needed)".
If BPI > 10 and EEB ≥ 10%: Marked as "Old Batteries (Replacement Needed)".
If BPI is None and EEB is None:
If mode > 50: Marked as "No Issue".
If mode ≤ 50: Marked as "Hardware Issue".
If 0 < BPI < 10 and EEB > 10%: Marked as "Unstable Old Batteries (Replacement Recommended)".
